Hello! Thanks for clicking the about page, Iâ€™m a seasoned IT and Cyber Security professional with over 20 years of experience in technology, spending the last decade dedicated to Cyber Security. I had the pleasure to work in almost all aspects of CyberSec going from Defending to Advisory to Management to Offensive.

This blog is mostly written from my own perspective and to help me understand deep technical topics better, I hold a strong portfolio of certifications, but I will not bore you with that. As you might have guessed I'm also a fan of Anime and Manga for even longer then my profesional career, these preferences will most likely also be found here.
