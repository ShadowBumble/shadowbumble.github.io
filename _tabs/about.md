Hello! Thanks for clicking the about page, Iâ€™m a seasoned IT and Cyber Security professional with over 20 years of experience in technology, including a decade dedicated exclusively to Cyber Security. 

This blog is mostly written from my own context and the help me understand deep technical topics better, I hold a strong portfolio of certifications, but I will not bore you with that. As you would have guessed I'm also a fan of Anime and Manga for even longer then my profesional career so touches of this will mostlikely also be found here.
